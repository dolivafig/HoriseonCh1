# Code Refactor Starter Code
## The purpose of this repo is to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, making sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also to rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## The following image shows the website with the old code and how it reacts when the window is minimized - the words and boxes loose their alignments and it looks messy.
