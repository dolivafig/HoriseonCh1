## The purpose of this repo is to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, making sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also to rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## The acceptance criteria is the following: GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.

## The following is a screenshot of the final product: (for code changes please reference the html and css files and their respective comments on changes commited.
